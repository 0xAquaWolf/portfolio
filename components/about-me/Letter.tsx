            <p>Hey everyone üëã</p>
            <p>I&apos;m AquaWolf, and I&apos;ve been on quite a journey.</p>
            <p>
              I&apos;ve been coding since 2016, and let me tell you, it&apos;s
              been a wild ride. Coding gets a bad rap sometimes, but it
              shouldn&apos;t. To me, coding has always been a treasure.
            </p>
            <p>
              There&apos;s nothing quite like the feeling of creating something
              from nothing, or solving a complex problem that&apos;s been
              nagging at you for days. That rush of satisfaction when your code
              finally runs smoothly‚Äîthat&apos;s how coding used to feel all the
              time for me.
            </p>
            <p>But things changed.</p>
            <p>
              In 2021, I got swept up in the crypto bull run. I helped launch
              various NFT projects, including DAW (Desperate Ape Wives) on ETH
              and TheLostKingdom on FTM. We&apos;re talking millions in sales
              and thousands in trading volume. It was exhilarating, but it came
              at a cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              I lost control over my well-being. An avalanche of work and stress
              buried me. I was coding for 12 hours a day, smoking weed just to
              cope with the pain. And still, it wasn&apos;t enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              The industry just let it happen. No one seemed to care about my
              health as long as the money kept flowing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coding, which had once been my joy, became a chore. Something I
              fell behind on. Something I cleared out, not cherished. Rather
              than delighting in it, I was just dealing with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But you know what? Even after all that, coding still remains a
              wonder to me. It&apos;s powerful. It&apos;s creative. It connects
              people across the globe and helps millions earn a living.
            </p>
            <p>
              The magic was still there, just buried under a mess of burnout and
              neglect.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I decided to make a change. I left it all behind and became a
              digital nomad. I traveled from the Amazon in Peru to the beaches
              of Thailand and the spiritual heart of India. I experienced
              ayahuasca 8 times in peru and 4 times in Thailand, spiritually
              died multiple times on DMT and mushrooms, kambo, san pedro, and
              went on various shamanic journeys over the course of 2 years
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a redo, a rethink, a simplified, potent reintroduction to
              my passion and my Self, i was lost and i found my Self in all of
              it, everything i was looking for outwardly was within.
            </p>
            <p>A fresh start, the way it should be.</p>
            <p>
              This journey became my love letter to balance and growth. I purged
              a lot of trauma, did a massive amount of shadow work, and finally
              found the peace I was looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I&apos;m no longer afraid to share my story. I&apos;m a
              Senior Full-Stack developer, yes, but I&apos;m also a shaman, a
              time traveler, a hacker, a tinker, a delusional optimist, a truth
              seeker, a data broker, an AI researcher, and a polymath.
            </p>
            <p>
              To everyone out there feeling lost or burnt out: there&apos;s
              hope.
            </p>
            <p>In the chaos there is always balance to find</p>
            <p>
              This is my journey, and I&apos;m still allowing the expansion to
              continue. May it inspire you to find your own balance in this wild
              world of technology and beyond.
