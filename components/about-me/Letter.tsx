            <p>What&apos;s Up Everyone, I&apos;m AquaWolf from Miami, FL</p>
            <p>
              So, my story&apos;s kinda wild. Started my coding journey back in 2016 
              with PHP - my first love, building simple websites and learning the magic 
              of server-side programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then I got caught up in the JavaScript hype train. React, TypeScript, 
              Next.js, Node.js - the whole modern ecosystem. Dove deep into design too - 
              mastering Figma, UI/UX principles, and creating pixel-perfect interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              I became truly full-stack - designing in Figma, developing with the latest 
              frameworks, and deploying on Linux machines. DevOps, design systems, 
              the works. Followed that wave straight into the crypto craze of October 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              Helped launch some really big NFT projects - DAW, TheLostKingdom & 
              SuperFuzz. My code generated over 28m+ and I achieved massive personal 
              success...
            </p>
            <p>But fuck, burnout hit me like a big 18 wheeler truck.</p>
            <p>I was lost, ship wrecked, stranded at sea with no boat.</p>
            <p>
              So I decided to shake things up. Went on a spiritual vision quest, 
              traveling the world for 2 years, searching for meaning and healing 
              from the chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep dive into consciousness, healing, and rediscovering what truly 
              mattered. I was so broken I honestly didn&apos;t even want to code 
              anymore, but eventually I found my way back to myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              And here&apos;s the beautiful part - I came full circle back to PHP. 
              WordPress, Laravel, the whole ecosystem that started it all.
            </p>
            <p>
              But now? Now I truly understand how everything connects. Design to 
              deployment, frontend to backend, the entire stack. After my journey 
              through JavaScript land and beyond, I can take an idea from Figma 
              mockup to production server - I&apos;ve finally mastered this craft.
            </p>
            <p>So, now I&apos;m back in the mix, wearing a bunch of hats:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Full-Stack PHP Developer (WordPress & Laravel)</li>
              <li>UI/UX Designer & Figma Expert</li>
              <li>DevOps Engineer (Linux & Cloud Deployment)</li>
              <li>Live Stream Coding (Building in Public)</li>
              <li>AI Tinkerer & Creative Problem Solver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              My mission is to bridge the gap between design and development, creating 
              end-to-end solutions from concept to deployment. I believe in building 
              experiences that are not just technically robust but also beautifully 
              designed and meaningfully crafted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Always open to connecting with fellow builders, designers, and
              curious minds. Whether it&apos;s discussing design systems, PHP frameworks, 
              DevOps workflows, or exploring new technological frontiers, I&apos;m
              here for it.
            </p>
            <p>Let&apos;s build the future together.</p>
