As Artificial Intelligence continues to advance, the possibility of using AI to augment human capabilities is becoming increasingly real. From brain-computer interfaces to AI-powered prosthetics, the line between human and machine is blurring, raising both exciting possibilities and ethical concerns.

Areas of AI-driven human augmentation:

- Brain-computer interfaces
- AI-enhanced prosthetics and exoskeletons
- Cognitive enhancement through AI assistants
- Augmented and virtual reality experiences
- Genetic engineering guided by AI

While the potential benefits of human augmentation are immense, it also raises profound ethical questions about equality, identity, and the very nature of what it means to be human.
