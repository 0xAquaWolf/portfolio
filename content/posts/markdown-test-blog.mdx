<p className="text-lg">
As the world grapples with the urgent threat of climate change, Artificial Intelligence is emerging as a powerful tool in the fight against global warming. From optimizing renewable energy systems to predicting extreme weather events, AI is helping us understand and address environmental challenges more effectively.
</p>

AI applications in climate action:

- Climate modeling and prediction
- Optimization of renewable energy systems
- Smart grid management
- Deforestation monitoring and prevention
- Sustainable agriculture and precision farming

While AI alone cannot solve the climate crisis, it offers valuable insights and tools that can accelerate our transition to a more sustainable future.

A paragraph, introducing a thematic break:

```ts
async function CodeBlock({ code, lang = 'ts' }: CodeBlockProps) {
  // Ensure code is a string
  console.log(code.code);

  const out = await codeToHtml(code.code, {
    lang,
    theme: 'catppuccin-macchiato',
  });

  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: out }} />;
}
```

a [link](https://example.com), an ![image](/images/png/PlaceholderBlogFeaturedImage1.png), some *emphasis*,
something **strong**, and finally a little `code()`.
